### WELCOME TO CODE SCHOOL
 
Our Code School is a hands-on class designed to train individuals to be entry-level software developers within a six-month course. The minimum education requirement is at least a high school diploma or GED. Students work in a small classroom setting and use real-word technologies to learn the fundamentals of coding, app development, the leadership, and the life skills needed for a successful career and job market competitiveness.
I entered in Code School because coding is something that I have always been interested in doing. I just felt like i was missing out sometimes. I'm thankful for the opportunity to learn about code through this program.
